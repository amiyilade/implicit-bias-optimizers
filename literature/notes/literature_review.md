# Hey, guys, you can download key papers and save them with the first author and paper title to literature/papers/ 

What to extract for the literature review:

1. Their experimental setup:
What architectures did they use?
What datasets?
What were their hyperparameters?
Exact training procedure

2. Their theoretical results:
What is the implicit bias of gradient descent?
Under what conditions does it hold?
What is the "optimization geometry"?


3. Their key findings:
What do the experiments show?
How do they verify theory?
